is a way to define images instead of having a single file for it (jpeg, img, etc.). It is essentially html (svg uses xml) but for images instead text. the images created are based on vectors and can be rendered at any size without loss of quality.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<svg height="100" width="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
  Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.  
</svg>

yaml:
Yaml used to create configuration files with any programming language. it creates file maps which contain the configuration information of other object or applications. even though in most cases it can be used interchangeably with json, yaml is considered more readable and user-friendly.
